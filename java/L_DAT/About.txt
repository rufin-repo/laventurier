This Java implementation of the game L'Aventurier is written by Rufin Hsu,
based on the board game of the same name designed by Raf Peeters.
Photorealistic and hand-drawn game board and room tile graphics
created by Rufin Hsu from scratch. Game board and pieces are photographed
with super-telephoto lens to eliminate perspective distortions, then
manually background-erased. Semi-transparent shadows manually painted.
